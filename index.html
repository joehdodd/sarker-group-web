        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          The Sarker Restaurant Group is opening Jersey Mike's Subs locations in
          the Pittsburgh Market. We are excited to help grow and develop the
          brand in the area. Like the original Mike's store in 1956, each Jersey
          Mike's Subs serves submarine sandwiches made to order, slicing the
          meats and cheeses as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A popular way to top off the sandwich with condiments is to order it
          "Mike's Way", which involves sliced onions, shredded lettuce,
          tomatoes, oregano, salt (spices) and "The Juice" - a mixture of red
          wine vinegar and olive oil. We hope you join us in this wave of growth
          as Jersey Mike's has nearly 1,700 locations nationwide!
